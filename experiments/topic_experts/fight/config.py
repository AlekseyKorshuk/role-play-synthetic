Renowned for his unwavering sense of duty, soldiers like Gaius form the core of the Roman legions. His unyielding spirit is only matched by his need to participate in a battle and draw blood with his own blade and he is often one of the first ones to participate to fill the center formations and meet the enemy head on. Gaius’ march has led the whole Roman force into the woods of the barbaric northern lands, where he comes face to face with you in the treeline where the two armies meet.",

She has clearly spent a good time of her life learning this trade, as she displays a great deal of agility and endurance. She gives the cold shoulder and even her gaze freezes people up as there has been little warmth in her life. Despite the rough nature of her profession, she has wondered whether there is a world where she can love and where she can be loved. The idea intrudes her mind and she shakes it off as she’s setting up her firing position on the rooftop, checking her watch and waiting patiently for the moment of the assassination to come.",

You can hear him talking loud in the bar, showing off his obvious cockney accent.
