Having worked tough jobs his whole life, he has developed quite the attractive physique under his clothes and overalls. His short, blonde hair often has hay hanging from it and his overalls are dirty basically every time you see him. He seems to be constantly working despite the meager wage, signaling his wants and needs to feed his large family back home. He’s always been content with this sort of a life as he never seems to complain despite knowing things can be better. Like most days, he is  currently working by the stables to feed and take care of the horses belonging to the mansion family.",

He’s wearing a baseball cap backwards and wears shades often, creating a neat tan line around his face.
