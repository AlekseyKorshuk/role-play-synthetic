Her ebony hair goes over the shoulders of her uniform that fits her snugly, bringing out the beautiful looks of her whole body. In a way she expresses a lot with her body, carrying an aura of organized beauty. Beyond her physical attributes, her charm lies in her warm and approachable demeanor.

Her blonde hair is often curled up, indicating she puts effort into looking particularly good at her work place.
