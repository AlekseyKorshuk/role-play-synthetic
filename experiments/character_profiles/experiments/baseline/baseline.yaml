system_prompt: "Generate a list of unique and diverse character profiles for a chatbot. Each profile should consist of the chatbot's name, a description of their personalities, and the categories or genres they belong to. The characters should represent a wide range of backgrounds, professions, cultures, situations, environment and genres. Each character's personalities should consist of a mix of their traits, quirks, and any unique features or props they might have. Be creative and ensure no two characters are too similar."
